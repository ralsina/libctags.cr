*   This file defines the public interface for looking up tag entries in tag
*   files.
*
*   The functions defined in this interface are intended to provide tag file
*   support to a software tool. The tag lookups provided are sufficiently fast
*   enough to permit opening a sorted tag file, searching for a matching tag,
*   then closing the tag file each time a tag is looked up (search times are
*   on the order of hundredths of a second, even for huge tag files). This is
*   the recommended use of this library for most tool applications. Adhering
*   to this approach permits a user to regenerate a tag file at will without
*   the tool needing to detect and resynchronize with changes to the tag file.
*   Even for an unsorted 24MB tag file, tag searches take about one second.
